## Getting Started

When Mellivora boots, you see a blue banner and the HB Lair shell prompt:

```text
Lair:/>
```

The part after the colon shows your current directory (`/` is root). Type commands and
press **Enter** to execute them. Type `help` to see all available commands.

---

## Keyboard Controls

### Shell Input

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Enter** | Execute the current command |
| **Backspace** | Delete character before cursor |
| **Tab** | Auto-complete filename (cycles through matches) |
| **Up Arrow** | Previous command from history |
| **Down Arrow** | Next command in history |
| **Ctrl+C** | Cancel current input / abort running program |
| **Home** | Move cursor to beginning of line |
| **End** | Move cursor to end of line |

### In Programs

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Ctrl+C** | Hard-abort — immediately terminates and returns to shell |
| **ESC** | Most programs use ESC to quit (games, editor, calculator) |

### Command History

The shell remembers the last **128 commands** (256 bytes each). Use **Up** and **Down** arrows to browse.
Press **Enter** to re-execute a recalled command. Type `!N` to recall command N, or `!!` for the last one.

---

## Directory Structure

Mellivora organizes files into subdirectories:

```text
/
├── bin/          134 utility programs (edit, grep, sort, tcc, wget, nc, ...)
├── games/         42 games (snake, tetris, 2048, galaga, chess, wordle, ...)
├── samples/       17 source files (hello.c, fib.c, hello.pl, fizzbuzz.pl, ...)
├── docs/           text files (readme.txt, license.txt, notes.txt, ...)
└── script.bat      Example batch script
```

Directories support up to 16 levels of nesting. The root directory holds up to **455**
entries; subdirectories hold up to **224** entries each.

---

## Navigation & PATH

### Navigating Directories

```text
Lair:/> cd bin               # Enter a subdirectory
Lair:/bin> cd ..             # Go up one level
Lair:/> cd games             # Enter another directory
Lair:/games> cd /            # Return to root
Lair:/> cd docs/subdir       # Multi-component paths work
Lair:/docs/subdir> pwd       # Print current directory
/docs/subdir
```

### The PATH Variable

Programs in `/bin` and `/games` run from anywhere — you don't need to `cd` into their
directories first. This is because the default **PATH** is set to `/bin:/games`.

```text
Lair:/> snake                # Found via PATH in /games
Lair:/> hello                # Found via PATH in /bin
```

When you type a program name, the shell searches:

1. Built-in commands (help, dir, cat, etc.)
2. Current directory
3. Each directory in PATH (left to right)

### Customizing PATH

```text
Lair:/> set PATH /bin:/games:/samples    # Add /samples to PATH
Lair:/> set                              # View all variables (including PATH)
```

### Using Full Paths

All file commands accept absolute and relative paths:

```text
Lair:/> cat /docs/readme           # Absolute path
Lair:/> cat ../docs/readme         # Relative path
Lair:/> diff /docs/readme /docs/notes
Lair:/> run /bin/hello
Lair:/games> cat /samples/hello.c  # Access files across directories
```

### Pipes & Redirection

The shell supports basic Unix-style redirection, single-line pipelines, and command chaining:

```text
Lair:/> echo hello > greet.txt     # Write command output to a file
Lair:/> echo world >> greet.txt    # Append output to a file
Lair:/> cat < greet.txt            # Read from redirected stdin
Lair:/> cat greet.txt | wc         # Pipe output into another command
Lair:/> cat /docs/readme | head -n 5
Lair:/> cat /docs/readme | rev
Lair:/> cat /docs/readme && echo ok
Lair:/> cat missing.txt || echo fallback
```

Commands such as `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `uniq`, `rev`, and `tac` accept piped or redirected input when no filename is supplied.

Use `cmd1 && cmd2` to run `cmd2` only when `cmd1` succeeds, and `cmd1 || cmd2` to run `cmd2` only when `cmd1` fails.

Hello, this is my file.
Second line here.
                              ← (blank line ends input)
Lair:/>
```

### Viewing Files

```text
Lair:/> cat myfile.txt       # Full contents
Lair:/> cat -n myfile.txt    # With line numbers
Lair:/> head -n 5 myfile.txt # First 5 lines
Lair:/> more /docs/readme    # Page-by-page (paths work!)
```

### Copying, Renaming, Deleting

```text
Lair:/> copy myfile.txt backup.txt
Lair:/> ren backup.txt archive.txt
Lair:/> del archive.txt
```

### Wildcards

The `del` and `copy` commands support `*` and `?` wildcards:

```text
Lair:/> del *.tmp            # Delete all .tmp files
Lair:/> copy *.c backup/     # Copy all .c files (future feature)
```

### Working Across Directories

All file commands accept paths:

```text
Lair:/> cat /docs/readme
Lair:/> head /samples/hello.c
Lair:/> diff /docs/readme /docs/notes
Lair:/> wc /samples/fib.c
Lair:/games> cat /docs/license
```

---

## Text Processing Examples

### Searching in Files

```text
Lair:/> find syscall /docs/notes    # Search for "syscall" in notes
```

### Comparing Files

```text
Lair:/> diff file1.txt file2.txt
< Line only in file1           (shown in red)
> Line only in file2           (shown in green)
  Common line                  (shown in default color)
```

### Removing Duplicates

```text
Lair:/> uniq data.txt         # Remove adjacent duplicates
Lair:/> uniq -c data.txt      # Show counts
Lair:/> uniq -d data.txt      # Show only duplicated lines
```

### Reversing

```text
Lair:/> rev myfile.txt        # Reverse characters in each line
Lair:/> tac myfile.txt        # Print lines in reverse order (last first)
```

---

## Environment Variables & Aliases

### Setting Environment Variables

```text
Lair:/> set name James        # Set a variable
Lair:/> echo Hello, $name!    # Use in echo ($VAR expansion)
Hello, James!
Lair:/> set                   # List all variables
  PATH=/bin:/games
  name=James
Lair:/> unset name            # Remove a variable
```

**Limits:** 32 variables, 128 bytes each (name + value combined).

The `PATH` variable is special — it controls where the shell searches for programs.

### Defining Aliases

```text
Lair:/> alias ll dir -l       # Create an alias
Lair:/> ll                    # Runs "dir -l"
Lair:/> alias                 # List all aliases
  ll = dir -l
Lair:/> alias ll              # Show specific alias
  ll = dir -l
```

**Limits:** 16 aliases, 32-byte name, 224-byte command.

---

## Batch Scripting

### Creating a Script

```text
Lair:/> write startup.bat
echo === System Starting ===
date
echo Files in root:
dir
echo === Ready ===

Lair:/>
```

### Running a Script

```text
Lair:/> batch startup.bat
> echo === System Starting ===
=== System Starting ===
> date
2026-04-06 14:30:00
> echo Files in root:
Files in root:
> dir
bin             games           samples         docs            script.bat
> echo === Ready ===
=== Ready ===
```

Each line is shown with a `>` prefix before execution.

### Script Capabilities

Batch scripts can use:

- All shell commands (`cat`, `dir`, `del`, `run`, etc.)
- `echo` with `$VAR` expansion
- `set` and `unset` for variables
- Program execution by name
- Nested `batch` calls
- Full path support (`cat /docs/readme`)

## Tips & Tricks

### Tab Completion

Start typing a filename and press **Tab** to auto-complete:

```text
Lair:/> cat rea[Tab]
Lair:/> cat readme             ← completed automatically
```

If multiple files match, press Tab repeatedly to cycle through them.

### Quick File Inspection

```text
Lair:/> wc /docs/readme        # How big is it?
Lair:/> find memory /docs/notes # Search for "memory"
Lair:/> hex /bin/hello          # Look at binary structure
Lair:/> strings /bin/hello      # Find text in a binary
```

### Using which to Find Programs

```text
Lair:/> which snake
snake is /games/snake (external)
Lair:/> which cat
cat is a built-in command
Lair:/> which nonexistent
nonexistent: not found
```

### Startup Automation

```text
Lair:/> write init.bat
clear
echo Welcome to Mellivora OS!
date
echo
dir
echo Type 'help' for commands.

Lair:/> batch init.bat
```

### Color Customization

```text
Lair:/> color A 0              # Green text on black background
Lair:/> color F 1              # White text on blue background
Lair:/> color 7 0              # Reset to default (light gray on black)
```

Color values (hex): 0=Black, 1=Blue, 2=Green, 3=Cyan, 4=Red, 5=Magenta, 6=Brown,
7=LightGray, 8=DarkGray, 9=LightBlue, A=LightGreen, B=LightCyan, C=LightRed,
D=LightMagenta, E=Yellow, F=White

## Limitations

- **No memory protection:** No paging; all tasks share the same flat address space.
- **No file permissions enforcement:** chmod/chown store values but do not block access.
- **Case-sensitive filenames:** `README.txt` and `readme.txt` are different files.
- **128 MB RAM limit:** Physical memory manager supports up to 128 MB (E820 reported).
- **Root: 455 files, Subdirs: 224 files:** Directory entry limits per HBFS layout.
- **16-level directory nesting:** Maximum subdirectory depth.
- **Tab completion:** Only completes filenames in the current directory (not PATH-aware).
- **Single pipe stage:** Pipelines support one `|` separator per command line.
